                    <p>The above image depicts the CAD model that was developed when designing the robot.
                        Being the Mechanical Lead, I was in charge of developing and assembling the major components of the CAD,
                        such as the bucket ladder, the conveyor belt, and the deposit basket, while integrating the
                        delegated CAD designs from mechanical team members into the overall design. The use of a design/decision matrix was
                        used to determine the best design choices for the given robot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was also in charge of running the finite element analysis (FEA) of the major components of the robot in order to 
                        determine modes of failure. Failure modes included; bending, shear, buckling, and general cyclic fatigue.
                        To do this, I utilized SolidWorks FEA and AutoDesk Inventor FEA. For basic components, rough hand calculations
                        were done to confirm the simulated results.

                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with designing and developing a child safety latch with given fatigue 
                        requirements and a factor of safety that must be met. The image above depicts the sketches of ideas that were produced prior to
                        the prototyping phase.
                        From this, I created a design/decision matrix to narrow down the potential options.
                        Ultimately, due to reduced costs in the molding and production process, the second, more simplisitc, design was chosen with ABS
                        plastic as the material.

                    <p>
                        It is to be noted that the CAD model was designed such that the child safety latch
                        would be screwed into the given cabinet. Every component within this model was also toleranced
                        within a region where no expected modes of failures, such as failure due to bending, 
                        shear, or buckling, were expected.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I was tasked with designing a gearbox for a large grandfather clock. As is with similar
                        projects, I was given specific criterion that I must meet. These criterion ranged from being within a certain company factor 
                        of safety to ensuring that the gears would not fatigue and fail. For this design, I once again created a design/decision matrix.
                        In this case, I first calculated sets of gear ratios to ensure that the clock would record time properly. From this, 
                        I weighed the costs of producing each gear and ultimately settled on a design.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the gear ratios and gears were set, I then began calculating the stresses that would be induced on the shafts,
                        allowing me to determine safe dimensions for the shafts holding the gears.
                    </p>
                    <p>The overall design is shown in the below image:</p>

                    <p>
                        When determining modes of failure, I focused on failure due to bending, buckling, shear, and fatigue in all components.
                        Infinite life was assumed due to the given facto of safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, each design was toleranced in a way that the factor of safety was met and 
                    no modes of failures occurred.

                    <p>
                        In the given project, I was tasked with designing a strut for a hydrofoil that would offer the least amount of 
                        drag as it is pulled through water. Specifications were given that had to be met once again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin with, I brainstormed and began sketching the different designs that I had for the given strut.
                        I then weighed each option in a design/decision matrix to determine which design to utilize.
                        Ultimately, I decided to use the circular strut due to its lower production cost and superior resistance to drag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sketches created are shown below:

                    <p>
                        I then compiled numerous calculations in order to determine the most optimum dimensions for the strut.
                        Once completed, a CAD model was generated.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I was tasked with designing a pogo stick with given fatigue criterion.
                        To begin with, I began weighing the benefits and flaws of a single spring, double spring, and triple spring
                        design. After developing a design/decision matrix, I determined that a double spring design would be best.
                        This is due to the reduction of force needed to bounce a given height and falling within a certain weight range
                        to acheive favorable results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final design of the pogo stick is depicted in the image below:

                    <img src = "images\PopOutPogo.jpg" alt = "dim str" width = "500" height = "650">
                    <p>Once the design was determined, I then ran calculations through matlab to determine the best
                        materials and dimensions to use for the both the frame of the pogo stick and the springs. In this case,
                        chrome-vanadium was chosen due to its resistive properties and light weight. Once determined, all components
                        were toleranced within a certain range to ensure a required factor of safety of 1.5.

                    <p>
                        For this project, me and a team of students wanted to investigate the behaviors of rocket noeses in a wind tunnel 
                        in our fluid mechanics lab. After discussing our curiosities with the professor, we were given permission to carry 
                        out this experiment. In order to do this, I first developed 3 separate CAD models for 3 different types of rocket noses.
                        I decided to test the difference between a bulbous, sharp, and streamlined nose design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once designed, I then 3D printed the different rocket heads. From here we were then able to test the different 
                        heads in the wind tunnel.
