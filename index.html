                        <p>The above image depicts the CAD model that was developed when designing the robot.
                            Being the Mechanical Lead, I was in charge of developing and assembling the major components of the CAD,
                            such as the bucket ladder, the conveyor belt, and the deposit basket, while integrating the
                            delegated CAD designs from mechanical team members into the overall design. The use of a design/decision matrix was
                            used to determine the best design choices for the given robot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was also in charge of running the finite element analysis (FEA) of the major components of the robot in order to 
                            determine modes of failure. Failure modes included bending, shear, buckling, and general cyclic fatigue.
                            To do this, I utilized SolidWorks FEA and AutoDesk Inventor FEA. For basic components, rough hand calculations
                            were done to confirm the simulated results.

                        <p>For this project, I was tasked with designing and developing a child safety latch with given fatigue 
                            requirements and a factor of safety that must be met. The image above depicts the sketches of ideas that were produced prior to
                            the prototyping phase.
                            From this, I created a design/decision matrix to narrow down the potential options.
                            Ultimately, due to reduced costs in the molding and production process, the second, more simplisitc, design was chosen with ABS
                            plastic as the material.

                        <p>
                            It is to be noted that the CAD model was designed such that the child safety latch
                            would be fastened into the given cabinet. Every component within this model was also toleranced
                            within a region where no expected modes of failures, such as failure due to bending, 
                            shear, or buckling, were expected.

                            For this project, I was tasked with designing a gearbox for a large grandfather clock. As is with similar
                            projects, I was given specific criterion that I must meet. These criterion ranged from being within a certain company factor 
                            of safety to ensuring that the gears would not fatigue and fail. For this design, I once again created a design/decision matrix.
                            In this case, I first calculated sets of gear ratios to ensure that the clock would record time properly. From this, 
                            I weighed the costs of producing each gear and ultimately settled on a design.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once the gear ratios and gears were set, I then began calculating the stresses that would be induced on the shafts,
                            allowing me to determine safe dimensions for the shafts holding the gears.
                        </p>
                        <p>The overall design is shown in the below image:</p>

                        <p>
                            When determining modes of failure, I focused on failure due to bending, buckling, shear, and fatigue in all components.
                            Infinite life was assumed due to the given factor of safety.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, each design was toleranced in a way that the factor of safety was met and 
                        no modes of failures occurred.

                        <p>
                            In the given project, I was tasked with designing a strut for a hydrofoil that would offer the least amount of 
                            drag as it is pulled through water. Specifications were given that had to be met once again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To begin with, I brainstormed and began sketching the different designs that I had for the given strut.
                            I then weighed each option in a design/decision matrix to determine which design to utilize.
                            Ultimately, I decided to use the circular strut due to its lower production cost and superior resistance to drag.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            I then compiled numerous calculations in order to determine the most optimum dimensions for the strut.
                            Once completed, a CAD model was generated.

                            For this project, I was tasked with designing a pogo stick with given fatigue criterion.
                            To begin with, I began weighing the benefits and flaws of a single spring, double spring, and triple spring
                            design. After developing a design/decision matrix, I determined that a double spring design would be best.
                            This is due to the reduction of force needed to bounce a given height and falling within a certain weight range
                            to acheive favorable results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final design of the pogo stick is depicted in the image below:

                        <p>Once the design was determined, I then ran calculations through matlab to determine the best
                            materials and dimensions to use for the both the frame of the pogo stick and the springs. In this case,
                            chrome-vanadium was chosen due to its resistive properties and light weight. Once determined, all components
                            were toleranced within a certain range to ensure a required factor of safety of 1.5.

                            For this project, me and a team of students wanted to investigate the behaviors of rocket noses in a wind tunnel 
                            in our fluid mechanics lab. After discussing our curiosities with the professor, we were given permission to carry 
                            out this experiment. In order to do this, I first developed 3 separate CAD models for 3 different types of rocket noses.
                            I decided to test the difference between a bulbous, sharp, and streamlined nose design.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I investigated the relationship between left and right hippocampus volumes in individuals 
                        being tested for dementia. The goal of this was to use a training data set to then utilize Naive Bayes Theorem
                        to predict whether a patient would develop dementia based on the volumes of their hippocampus.
                    </p>
                    <p>The dataset was acquired from the given site: http://www.oasis-brains.org/.</p>
                    <p>
                        Using the dataset above, I acquired a training and a testing set so that I would be able
                        to determine the overall accuracy of my algorithm. I then determined the 
                        four different scenarios that could occur from the dataset provided, these scenarios being 
                        the likelihood that it is the left hippocampus volume given the patient is healthy or has dementia 
                        and the likelihood that it is the right hippocampus volume given the patient
                        is healthy or has dementia. From here, I then calculated the gaussian
                        probability density function for each scenario. I then calculated the probability that the patient
                        in the test data set has dementia utilizing the training set and the Naive Bayes equation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall accuracy of my written algorithm was <b>72.6%</b>, meaning that given a dataset where 
                        it is unknown whether the individual has dementia or healthy given their left and right hippocampus
                        volumes, my program would be able to identify who developed dementia 72.6% of the time.

                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I was tasked with determining whether men or women have a higher chance of developing hypertension.
                        To approach this, given the population data, I decided to write a hypergeometric distribution function and utilize a 
                        contingency table to determine the different probabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin with, I began by developing a null hypothesis, that both men and women have the same probability of developing hypertension.
                        Utilizing pandas, seaborn, and numpy, I was then able to determine a p-value to compare to a significance value of .05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results depicted a p-value of <b>.024</b>. Because this was less than the significance value of 0.05, I 
                        rejected the null hypothesis and determined that men and women do not share the same chance of developing hypertension in that
                        women actually have a greater chance of developing hypertension.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I utilized principle component analysis (PCA) in order to plot a given set of data points that make up a hand and 
                        manipulate the points through linear algebra in order to change the overall hand shape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to do this, I first began by computing the covariance matrix of the given hand.
                        Once this was done, I computed the PCA eigenanalysis and plotted the principal components in order to analyze the changes made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below is an example image of one of the principle components plotted:

                        As it can be seen in the image, the hand seems to spread its fingers as the factor being applied to it increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final part that I wanted to investigate was how well the hand could be projected over the original data using
                        a weighted vector.
                    </p>

                        For this project, I wrote an algorithm that would be able to identify the difference between frogs and planes.
                        In order to do this, I read in thousands of images of frogs and planes and mapped the images to matrices.
                        From there, I wrote a logistic regression model algorithm utilizing gradient ascent and log-likelihood maximization to be able to 
                        predict whether the image being read is a frog or an plane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After running the model numerous times, my algorithms accuracy came out to be <b>89.4%</b>, meaning that given a random set of images of planes
                        and frogs, the program would be able to correctly identify each image 89.4% of the time.

                <div class="showMore" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                        After seeing the SPOT robot by Boston Dynamics, I knew I had to try and engineer my own quadruped robot! The general idea for this project was for me to
                        make a DIY quadruped with features that I would like to see with it. To begin with I want RexBo to be able to have obstacle avoidance and also facial recognition.
                        The idea with this is to have RexBo trot around my apartment and use facial recogition with cameras/optical sensors to determine if it should wave, or "insult".
                        I also want it to be able to traverse over complex terrains, from slipper and sloped surfaces to jagged uneven surfaces. These are all future implementations that 
                        I am going to be working and prototyping on in the near future. There are a lot of considerations that have to be taken into account when designing this, from the weight
                        of RexBo and the strength of the motors, to the thermal implications that the electronic systems have on the materials used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently at the point where I have the basic design of RexBo V1 down. RexBo is able to stand and dance using a RaspberryPi. I also simulated the robot and its 
                        inverse kinematic model in pyBullet using python to begin with. This was all hand derived and calcuated then transferred into code. The current plan is to
                        get the rough working form of RexBo using python and the RaspberryPi, then fine tune the code by transferring it to C++ for more precise memory allocation,
                        increasing efficiency and decreasing latency as it runs continuously.

                <div class="showMore" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                        For my senior capstone project, I decided to focus on developing an electroenchephologram (EEG) controlled rehabilitative robotic exoskeleton. This project was meant
                        to aid patients with little to no muscle activation in their arms to start training their brain and muscles to rehabilitate and restore muscle activation.
                        An EEG is a "helmet" device wired with electrodes that connect to the users head. This machine is then able to read in brain activity and output it as noisy voltage
                        signals. Knowing this, I was able to pair this device with a machine learning algorithm and a pneumatic controlled exoskeleton to classify brain signals as three movements, "left", 
                        "right", and "stationary" in real-time. This means that if a patient is thinking of moving the noted arm to the right, left, or leaving it stationary, then the
                        machine learning classifier algorithm will allow for the data to be read and separated into those sections, allowing for the exoskeleton to actuate to the left, right, or be held
                        stationary automatically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the design of this exoskeleton, I opted to use a light weight design that is rated to hold the weight of an arm and is also able to have rollers installed on the base
                        so that the device can roll given an actuation method. The actuation method in this case was using pneumatics. This was due to the resources that I was given, if possible, I would
                        prefer to have used an electric motor with low audio outputs as any little change/distraction in the individuals environment could cause drastically different signals,
                        making it difficult to classify a given movement in a machine learning model. This will be touched on later. The pneumatic was controlled using an air pump source and an 
                        Arduino Nano while the real-time classification was done using a RaspberryPi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are images of the design, assembly, and circuit diagram of the system:

                    <p>
                        In order to classify movements from the noisy signals, I utilized a CNN algorithm with preprocessing filters and numerous layers being applied to the data.
                        The two major preprocessing filters used in this case were the Sobel Kernel and the Gaussian Kernel. Sobel Kernel allowed for edge detection in the EEG data whereas
                        the Gaussian kernel normalizes the data. The layers utilized were a Linear Sequential Model, Conv2D Layers, Batch Normalization Layers, Max Pooling Layers,
                        Dropout Layers, Flatten Layers, and Dense Layers. For the activation function, due to its efficiency, we utilized the LeakyReLU function. 
                        All of these aspects of the code utilized in conjunction allowed for feature extraction and classification. After gathering a training set of over 100,000 data points (all from my own head)
                        I was able to create a training and test set for classifier weight calculations. Given these weights, we can then use these weights during real-time EEG readings to classify the movements
                        as the data is being collected.

                    <p>
                        Overall, I was able to beat a random classification. Given that there were three possible movements, then purely random would be
                        about 33%. However, my algorithm achieved an accuracy of 43%.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I collaborated with a team of 5 engineers to develop an electric guitar and two pedals to pair.
                        In this project, I assisted with the initial idea and design of this guitar using SolidWorks.
                        Although I assisted in the design development, I was primarily focused on the circuit conceptualization and building of the two pedals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Once the general concept was created, I spearheaded the design choice of having movable wings on the guitar that, when moved, affected
                       the overall volume and tone of guitar. Given time restraints, this was not successfully achieved, however we were able to prototype
                       the movable wing properly. This was done by setting up two interlocked gears at the base of each wing and connecting them within a hollow housing
                       unit on the back of the guitar. This allowed the gears to be hidden from sight, while allowing for smooth movements of the wings.

                    <p>
                        For the pedals, I decided to develop one known pedal and one custom pedal to suit the needs that my team and I determined.
                        To begin with, I modeled and built an overdrive pedal on NI Multisim and a breadboard. The design is fairly simple, with 2 major 
                        components; the op-amp and the diodes. The op-amp in this case was wired in a non-inverting amplifier configuration which allowed for 
                        the maximization of gain to be possible. The diodes in this case were set-up to create clipping within the signal, allowing for the peaks of the
                        signals to be flattened. By using two diodes in this configuration, it causes soft-clipping due to the fact that it is in the feedback loop of 
                        the op-amp. This means that the peaks of the signals are partially clipped, allowing for distortion to be present within the output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are images of the overdrive circuit model, breadboard, and output waveform:
                    </p>
                    <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tiskk/TIShamsWeb/main/images/overdrive.png" alt = "overdrive circuit" width="600" height="345">

                    <p>
                        The custom pedal was aimed to mimic the sound of an engine starting in the beginning of the note being played to match the theme of the 
                        F-14 Tomcat. This could be done by maximizing the gain, as was done in the overdrive pedal, while hard clipping the top of the waveform.
                        With this in mind, I was able to begin developing the circuit. For the first portion of the circuit, I had set up another op-amp in the non-inverting
                        amplifier configuration, but this time I added a capacitor to the feedback loop of the amplifier. This essentially acts as a low pass filter,
                        limiting higher frequencies while allowing lower frequencies to pass through. This reduces noise in the system. In addition, I implemented a
                        diode at the output of the op-amp causing hard clipping. This essentially takes the peak signal and flattens it. The final component was another
                        op-amp in the inverted configuration with a PNP transistor at the output of the circuit. This increased the overall current output 
                        and gradually decreased the voltage output. This circuit led to a popping/revving sound at the beginning of the note, while tapering off
                        into distortion as the signal continued.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I wanted to simulate the opening and closing mechanism of a car window.
                        I set it so that the simulated car window would open until it reaches a minimum point and close until it reaches its maximum point.
                        In order to simulate the minimum and maximum points, I utilized IR Distance sensors. To change the direction of the motor,
                        I utilized a 4 relay system modeling an H-bridge circuit. Once this was done, I wanted to implement a pinch mechanism, so that
                        in the case a finger or a hand gets stuck when the window was closing, then the window would stop and then begin to open once again.
                        To simulate this portion, I used a power resistor and an opamp as a comparator and lightly grabbed the motor to cause a spike in current.

                        To activate multi-processes, I activated different cogs on the microcontroller. Doing so allowed the game to run

                        For this project, I investigated the replacement of CAMs in an antique sewing machine with a stepper motor.
                        Through this I was able to determine a certain step size for the bipolar stepper motor that acheived the same results as the 
                        CAM.

                        The reasoning behind this was to see if mechanical components could be automated and programmed, allowing for less maintenance to be done.
